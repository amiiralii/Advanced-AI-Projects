##NQueens Problem
solved by simple backtracking, forward checking, and maintaining arc consistency.

How to run the code?

Use the following format:
python main.py MAC/FOR #Dimension_of_board FileNAme

For example following command will run the code for 10 queen problem 
    with forward checking algorithm, and saves the results into a file in the same directory named results.txt
python main.py FOR 10 results.txt

** On top of that, it is worth mentioning that the results.txt file only contains the first 2*n solutions.
    For example, for the n=10, the total number of solutions is 724, but there are only 20 boards containing the final solution available in the results.txt.

Also, each time running the code properly, you will see the time duration for running the code in the command line.(seconds)
